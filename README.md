My solutions to Advent of Code 2024

We'll see how much of it I do this year, last year was [fun](https://github.com/alexcjohnson/aoc2023) but maybe a bit much. DEFINITELY not going to let myself start at midnight when the day turns over.

My intent is to again use the Python standard library only.

As [requested by AOC](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about), I'll omit the puzzle inputs and descriptions and commit just my solutions. Most days assume you stored two files, `dayXXtest.txt` and `dayXXinput.txt`. If you want to run against the test file, add `t` to the command, ie `python day13.py t`. To run against the full input, just `python day13.py`
